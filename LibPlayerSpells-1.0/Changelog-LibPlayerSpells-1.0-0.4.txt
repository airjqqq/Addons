Tagging for release


--------------------

Rainrider:
	- Fix deploying tags
	I suck a copy-pasting ...
	- Changed deplay condition to push tags
	- data: increment all data revisions
	Not sure if needed, but better safe than sorry
	- docs: remove RAIDBUFF and expand CROWD_CTRL documentation
	- core: :GetCrowdControlCategoryName returns a string
	Every CC spelll belongs to one DR category only
	- mage: list Ice Nova outside CROWD_CTRL
	I still need to confirm whether it belongs to CC DR category or not.
	- core: clear dispel and crowd control flags before applying the category flags
	- data: add taunts to their CROWD_CTRL category
	Pet and AoE taunts are usable on bosses and thus do not belong to the
	TAUNT DR category.
	- mask: re-work masks (WIP)
	Remove RAIDBUFFS.
	Add DISPEL and CROWD_CTRL as specials.
	Merge both *_REGEN into POWER_REGEN.

	- paladin: add Power of the Silver Hand (holy artifact trait)
