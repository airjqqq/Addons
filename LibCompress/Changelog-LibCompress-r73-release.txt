Fixed: Symbol map decoding in Huffman was malfunctioning when the symbol length became too long.
Added: huffman compression has received a number of checks for overflows. Remember to check for (nil,msg) compression result!
Added: Store compression added to make a simple uncompressed string in case compression fails. Is basically the original string with a prefix byte.
